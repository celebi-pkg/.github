This organization serves to maintain some of the large-scale projects that I have created. Feel free to check out these highlighted projects:

A Python package designed to aid in debugging assembly code. Allows for users to translate assembly code to binary in a variety of formats. See [documentation](https://celebi-pkg.github.io/riscv-assembler/) for more info.
